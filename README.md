Managers package have been created for managing Reading files, WebDriver and Page objects
For Data provider created DataProviders package. CustomerDataBean have been created to pass data for customer details. ConfigFileReader for reading configuration properties. JsonDataReader to read Json files for test data.
All Steps have been kept for each page in Steps package
Kept all support methods in Utils package.
